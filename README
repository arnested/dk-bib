Dk-bib is a translation of the fours standard BibTeX style files
(abbrv, alpha, plain and unsrt) into Danish.

The files have been extended with ISBN and ISSN fields.

Actually these files were translated from the Norwegian translation
(by Dag Langmyhr) into Danish. Dag also made the extension for ISBN
and ISSN.

The files are named dk-abbrv, dk-alpha, dk-plain and dk-unsrt.
